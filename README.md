# Workforce Productivity & Capacity Analysis  

This project analyzes how employee productivity, capacity, satisfaction, and manager influence intersect inside a workforce.  
Using a synthetic dataset of 200 employees, I explored key operational and people-analytics metrics that help organizations detect burnout early, optimize workload distribution, and improve manager effectiveness.

## 📊 Project Overview

Many companies struggle with identifying:

- Which teams are at full capacity  
- Which managers drive high performance  
- Where overtime might be signaling early burnout  
- How productivity varies across departments  

This project uses Python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib to build a simulation and visualize workforce dynamics.

## 🧠 Key Questions Answered

### 1. **How productive is each team?**  
Calculated as: productivity = tasks_completed / hours_worked

### 2. **How does overtime impact satisfaction?**  
A heatmap shows a strong downward trend — more overtime = lower morale.

### 3. **How do managers influence productivity?**  
Boxplots reveal variation in team output across managers.

### 4. **Are employees burning out?**  
Employees were flagged as **High Risk** if:
- Overtime hours > 7  
- Satisfaction score < 3.2
